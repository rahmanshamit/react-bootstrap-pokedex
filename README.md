# react-bootstrap-pokedex
Pokedex that pulls data from the free Pokemon API using ReactJS. This is mainly for bootstrap, api and components practice, and I also wanted to build a clean and fun UI.
It's just pulling the names and image for now, but I'll add in pokemon stats, types and a search feature that I'm currently working on.
